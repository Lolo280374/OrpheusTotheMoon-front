    <h2>compatibility</h2>
    <p>this "game" is compatible on any device running at minimum Android 9 or above (Android 9 corresponding to API 28). you will also need physical sensors on your phone for the game experience to correctly run: you need to shake the phone up and down to fly up in the air.</p>
    <p>install the game, and you'll immediately tell if they work or not!</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>installation</h2>
    <p>to install, please go to the <a href="https://github.com/Lolo280374/OrpheusTotheMoon/releases">releases tab</a>, grab the latest APK avalaible, and install it on your Android (9+) device!</p>
    <p>note that you may get a Play Protect alert, and that is normal due to the fact that this app has little to no installs, and that I'm not wishing to pay for a Google Play dev acc! you can review the code if you wish, but such alerts are normal.</p>

    <h2>how to play</h2>
    <p>this game is very simple to play! if you've ever played soda shake on Wii Party, or anything similar to that (I think the Switch had a similar title but I forgot the name entirely), well that's exactly the same logic! </p>
    <p>move to the fly page, and shake your phone up to fly into the air! once you reach the moon, you're there, and you get coins!</p>
    <p>these coins can allow you to buy cosmetics, and that's it! yep sorry! but at least you'll have made orpheus and heidi reach the moon! good job to you.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>store items</h2>
    <p>there are only 3 items in this store, being purely cosmetic! they are inspired from the Siege store's page, but edited to fit with the flying Orpheus from the game's fly page:</p>
    <p>they consist of the following:</p>
    <li>orpheus cowboy hat,</li>
    <li>orpheus sailor hat,</li>
    <li>satchel for orpheus.</li>
    <p>that's it!</p>

    <h2>credits</h2>
    <p>many thanks to these, who without them, the project would probably not have been the same, or looked the same at all!</p>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/ocegik/Material3Expressive/">a Material 3 expressive demo</a> - helped me understand how to add Material You to my app!</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC-J0t8fyuc/">Native Mobile Bits</a> - same thing as the Material 3 expressive demo, but it helped me put it in practice with actual demos!</li>
